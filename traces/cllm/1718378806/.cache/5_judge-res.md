Explanation:
The response provides a clear and concise explanation of what CLLM is and how it works. It accurately describes CLLM as a Command Line Language Model tool designed for interacting with language models via the command line, and it mentions some of its functionalities such as listing available systems and schemas, generating prompts, and validating responses. The response also briefly explains how to use CLLM by running the cllm command with appropriate arguments and options.

However, there are a few areas for improvement:
1. The response could be more specific about the source. Instead of citing "docs/README.md," it should cite the exact source provided in the context, such as "docs/cllm.md."
2. The response could include a bit more detail on the usage of CLLM, such as mentioning the environment variable CLLM_PATH or the default .cllm folder, to give a more comprehensive overview.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Cite the exact source from the context.
2. Include a brief mention of the environment variable CLLM_PATH and the default .cllm folder to provide a more complete picture of how CLLM works.
