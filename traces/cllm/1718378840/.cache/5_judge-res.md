**Revised Response:**

cllm is a command-line interface for interacting with language models, providing functionalities like listing available systems and schemas, generating prompts from templates, and validating responses against schemas (source: docs/cllm.md). It works by running the cllm command with appropriate arguments and options, such as system configurations and prompts. For example, to list all available systems, one can run `cllm systems` (source: docs/cllm.md).
