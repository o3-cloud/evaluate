 The Command Line Language Model (CLLM) Interface is a tool designed for interacting with language models via the command line, facilitating functionalities like listing systems/schemas, generating prompts, and validating responses. It operates by executing commands specified in YAML files within its $CLLM_PATH/systems directory, using these configurations to run system-specific tasks (CONTEXT: "Command Line Language Model (CLLM) Interface").

For example, the `cllm` command can be used with arguments and options to perform various actions, such as generating prompts from templates or validating responses against schemas. The interface also supports persistent context for conversations using `--chat-context`, and it expects a `.cllm` folder in the current working directory by default (CONTEXT: "By default cllm expects that a .cllm folder exists...").
